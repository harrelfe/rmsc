# Missing Data {#sec-missing-data}

## Types of Missing Data
`r mrg(sound("missing-1"))`

* Missing completely at random (MCAR) `r ipacue()`
* Missing at random (MAR)^["Although missing at random (MAR) is a non-testable assumption, it has been pointed out in the literature that we can get very close to MAR if we include enough variables in the imputation models" @har07mul.]
* Informative missing (non-ignorable non-response; missing not at random; MNAR)

See @car21mis, @sch02mis, @don06rev, @har07mul, @all01mis, @whi11mul, @buu12fle for an
introduction to missing data and imputation concepts.
<!-- NEW: -->
See @haz23tri for a way to indirectly detect MNAR by comparing variances of response variables between treatments.

## Prelude to Modeling

* Quantify extent of missing data `r ipacue()`
* Characterize types of subjects with missing data
* Find sets of variables that are missing on same subjects
 

## Missing Values for Different Types of Response Variables

* Serial data with subjects dropping out (not covered in this `r ipacue()`
  course^[@twi13mul found instability in using multiple imputation of longitudinal data, and advantages of using instead full likelihood models.]
<!-- TODO twi13mul is epub--->
* Excellent tutorial on imputation of longitudinal data: @wij25mul
* $Y$=time to event, follow-up curtailed: covered under survival
  analysis^[@whi09imp provide a method for multiply imputing missing covariate values using censored survival time data.]
<!-- NEW following: -->
* Missing time-dependent covariates in longitudinal data: @mam23lon
* Often discard observations with completely missing $Y$ but sometimes wasteful^[$Y$ is so valuable that if one is only missing a $Y$ value, imputation is not worthwhile, and imputation of $Y$ is not advised if MCAR or MAR.]
* Characterize missings in $Y$ before dropping obs.


## Problems With Simple Alternatives to Imputation
Deletion of records---

* Badly biases parameter estimates when the probability of a `r ipacue()`
  case being incomplete is related to $Y$ and not just
  $X$ [@littlerubin].
* Deletion because of a subset of $X$ being missing
        always results in inefficient estimates
* Deletion of records with missing $Y$ can result in
        biases [@cra95com] but is the preferred approach
        under MCAR^[Multiple imputation of $Y$ in that case does not improve the analysis and assumes the imputation model is correct.]
* @hip07reg found advantages to a "use
  all variables to impute all variables then drop observations with
  missing $Y$" approach (but see @sul15bia)
* @lee12rec suggest that observations missing
	on both $Y$ and on a predictor of major interest are not helpful
* Only discard obs. when
    + MCAR can be justified
    + Rarely missing predictor of overriding importance that can't be
   imputed from other data
    + Fraction of obs. with missings small and $n$ is large

* No advantage of deletion except savings of analyst time
* Making up missing data better than throwing away real data
* See @kno10unp


Adding extra categories of categorical predictors---

* Including missing data but adding a category `missing' causes `r ipacue()`
        serious biases [@all01mis; @jon96ind; @vac98mis]
* Problem acute when values missing because subject too sick
* Difficult to interpret
* Fails even under MCAR [@jon96ind; @all01mis; @don06rev; @hei06imp; @kno10unp]
* May be OK if values are "missing" because of "not
  applicable"^[E.g. you have a measure of marital happiness, dichotomized as high or low, but your sample contains some unmarried people.  OK to have a 3-category variable with values high, low, and unmarried---Paul Allison, IMPUTE list, 4Jul09.]
* May be OK for pure prediction where interpretation of coefficients is of no interest and patterns of missingness will be the same in future data as in the training data

Likewise, serious problems are caused by setting missing continuous
predictors to a constant (e.g., zero) and adding an indicator variable
to try to estimate the effect of missing values.

Two examples from @don06rev using binary logistic
regression, $N=500$.


Results of 1000 Simulations With $\beta_{1}=1.0$ with MAR
  and Two Types of Imputation `r ipacue()` 


| Imputation | $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ | S.E. | Coverage of  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Method     |                  |      | 0.90 C.I.   |
| Single     | 0.989            | 0.09 | 0.64  |
| Multiple   | 0.989            | 0.14 | 0.90   |


Now consider a simulation with $\beta_{1}=1, \beta_{2}=0$, $X_{2}$
correlated with $X_{1} (r=0.75)$ but redundant in predicting $Y$, use
missingness indicator when $X_{1}$ is MCAR in 0.4 of 500 subjects.
This is also compared with grand mean fill-in imputation.


Results of 1000 Simulations Adding a Third Predictor Indicating Missing for $X_{1}$} `r ipacue()` 


| Imputation | $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ | $\hat{\beta}_{2}$  |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Method     |                  |                     |
| Indicator  | 0.55             | 0.51               |
| Overall mean| 0.55            |                     |


In the incomplete observations the constant $X_{1}$ is uncorrelated
with $X_{2}$.


## Strategies for Developing an Imputation Model

**The goal of imputation is to preserve the information and meaning of the non-missing data.**

`r mrg(sound("missing-2"))`


There is a full Bayesian modeling alternative to all the methods
presented below.  The Bayesian approach requires more effort but has
several advantages [@erl16dea].



Exactly how are missing values estimated?

* Predictive model for each target uses any outcomes, all
    predictors in the final model other than the target, plus
    auxiliary variables not in the outcome model
* Could ignore all other information --- random or grand mean `r ipacue()`
  fill-in
* Can use external info not used in response model (e.g., zip
  code for income)
* Need to utilize reason for non-response if possible
* Use statistical model with sometimes-missing $X$ as response
  variable
* Model to estimate the missing values should include all
  variables that are either `r ipacue()` 
 
1. related to the missing data mechanism;
1. have distributions that differ between subjects that have the
   target variable missing and those that have it measured;
1. associated with the sometimes-missing variable when it is not
   missing; or
1. included in the final response model [@bar04imp; @har07mul]

* Ignoring imputation results in biased $\hat{V}(\hat{\beta})$
* `transcan` function in Hmisc library: "optimal"
  transformations of all variables to make residuals more stable and
  to allow non-monotonic transformations
* `aregImpute` function in Hmisc: good approximation to full
  Bayesian multiple imputation procedure using the bootstrap
* `transcan` and `aregImpute` use the following for fitting
  imputation models: `r ipacue()` 
  
1. initialize `NA`s to median (mode for categoricals)
1. expand all categorical predictors using dummy variables
1. expand all continuous predictors using restricted cubic splines
1. optionally optimally transform the variable being predicted by
    expanding it with restricted cubic splines and using the first
    canonical variate (multivariate regression) as the optimum
    transformation (maximizing $R^2$)
1. one-dimensional scoring of categorical variables being
    predicted using canonical variates on dummy variables representing
    the categories (Fisher's optimum scoring algorithm); when imputing
    categories, solve for which category yields a score that is
    closest to the predicted score

* `aregImpute` and `transcan` work with `r ipacue()`
  `fit.mult.impute` to make final analysis of response variable
  relatively easy
* Predictive mean matching
* Recursive partitioning with surrogate splits --- handles case
  where a predictor of a variable needing imputation is missing
  itself.  But there are problems [@pen18pro] even with completely
  random missingness.
* @whi11mul discusses an alternative method based on
  choosing a donor observation at random from the $q$ closest matches
  ($q=3$, for example)



### Interactions

* When interactions are in the outcome model, oddly enough it may `r ipacue()`
  be better to treat interaction terms as "just another variable"
  and do unconstrained imputation of them [@kim15eva]



## Single Conditional Mean Imputation
`r mrg(sound("missing-3"))`


* Can fill-in using unconditional mean or median if number of `r ipacue()`
  missings low and $X$ is unrelated to other $X$s
* Otherwise, first approximation to good imputation uses other
  $X$s to predict a missing $X$
* This is a single "best guess" conditional mean
* $\hat{X}_{j} =  Z \hat{\theta}, Z = X_{\bar j}$ plus possibly
  auxiliary variables that precede $X_{j}$ in the causal chain that
  are not intended to be in the outcome model.<br>
Cannot include $Y$ in $Z$ without adding random errors to imputed
values as done with multiple imputation (would steal info from $Y$)
* Recursive partitioning can sometimes be helpful for nonparametrically
  estimating conditional means



## Predictive Mean Matching

* Developed by @littlerubin
* Replace missing value with observed value of subject having closest predicted
        value to the predicted value of the subject with the `NA`.
        Key considerations are how to
   
1. model the target when it is not `NA`
1. match donors on predicted values
1. avoid overuse of "good" donors to disallow excessive ties in
     imputed data
1. account for all uncertainties

* No distributional assumptions; nicely handles target variables
    with strange distributions [@vin14pre]
* Predicted values need only be monotonically related to real
    predictive values
    + PMM can result in some donor observations being used repeatedly `r ipacue()`
    + Causes lumpy distribution of imputed values
    + Address by sampling from multinomial distribution,
   probabilities = scaled distance of all predicted values to
   predicted value ($y^{*}$) of observation needing imputing
    + Tukey's tricube function is a good weighting function (used in
   loess): $w_{i} = (1 - \min(d_{i}/s, 1)^{3})^{3}$, <br>
   $d_{i} = |\hat{y_{i}} - y^{*}|$ <br>
   $s = 0.2\times\text{mean} |\hat{y_{i}} - y^{*}|$ is a good default
   scale factor <br>
   scale so that $\sum w_{i} = 1$

<!-- NEW -->

### Predictive Mean Matching With Constraints {#sec-missing-constraints}

* PMM is empirical so it is relatively easy to add constraints
   + Need sample size to be large enough so that there are several donor observations meeting the constraints
* Implemented in `Hmisc` 5.1-1
* For each variable to be imputed the user can specify an R expression that is a logical TRUE/FALSE condition specifying which observations qualify
* Constraint can involve relationships between potential donor observations (variables prefixed by `d$`) and the recipient (target) observation (variables prefixed by `r$`) having the missing value
* PMM on the qualifying donor observations
* Example
   + time 0 corresponds to the day a patient is admitted to the hospital
   + day of discharge is missing for some patients
   + every patient had at least one follow-up visit
   + constrain the day of discharge to be before the day of the first follow-up visit

```{r eval=FALSE}
a <- aregImpute(~ age + day_dis + day_follow_up, data=d,
                constraint=list(day_dis=expression(d$day_dis < r$day_follow_up)))
```


## Multiple Imputation

* Single imputation could use a random draw from the conditional `r ipacue()`
        distribution for an individual <br>
        $\hat{X}_{j} = Z \hat{\theta} + \hat{\epsilon}, Z = [X\bar{j},
        Y]$ plus auxiliary variables <br>
        $\hat{\epsilon} = n(0, \hat{\sigma})$ or a random draw from the
        calculated residuals
    + bootstrap
    + approximate Bayesian bootstrap [@rub91mul; @har07mul]: sample
   with replacement from sample with replacement of residuals

* Multiple imputations ($M$) with random draws
    + Draw sample of $M$ residuals for each missing value to be imputed
    + Average $M$ $\hat{\beta}$
    + In general can provide least biased estimates of $\beta$
    + Simple formula for imputation-corrected
    var($\hat{\beta}$) <br> Function of average "apparent"
    variances and between-imputation variances of
    $\hat{\beta}$
    + Even when the $\chi^2$ distribution is a good approximation
    when data have no missing values, the $t$ or $F$ distributions are
    needed to have accurate $P$-values and confidence limits when
    there are missings [@lip02deg; @rei07sma]
    + **BUT** full multiple imputation needs to account for
    uncertainty in the imputation models by refitting these models for
    each of the $M$ draws
    + `transcan` does not do that; `aregImpute` does

* Note that multiple imputation can and should use the response
  variable for imputing predictors [@moo06usi]
* `aregImpute` algorithm [@moo06usi] `r ipacue()` 
`r mrg(sound("missing-4"))`
    + Takes all aspects of uncertainty into account using the
   bootstrap
    + Different bootstrap resamples used for each imputation by fitting
   a flexible additive model on a sample with replacement
   from the original data
    + This model is used to predict all of the original missing and
   non-missing values for the target variable for the current imputation
    + Uses flexible parametric additive regression models to impute
    + There is an option to allow target variables to be optimally
 transformed, even non-monotonically (but this can overfit)
    + By default uses predictive mean matching for imputation; no residuals
   required (can also do more parametric regression imputation)
    + By default uses weighted PMM; many other matching options
    + Uses by default van~Buuren's "Type 1" matching \cite[Section
   3.4.2]{buu12fle} to capture the right amount of uncertainty by
   computing predicted values for missing values using a
   regression fit on the bootstrap sample, and finding donor
   observations by matching those predictions to predictions from potential
   donors using the regression fit from the original sample
   of complete observations
   + Uses Rubin's rule to estimate variances of $\hat{\beta}$, involving between- and within-imputation variance combination
    + When a predictor of the target variable is missing, it is first
   imputed from its last imputation when it was a target variable
    + First 3 iterations of process are ignored ("burn-in")
    + Compares favorably to `R` `MICE` approach
    + Example:
    
```{r eval=FALSE,timeit=FALSE}
a <- aregImpute(~ age + sex + bp + death + heart.attack.before.death,
                data=mydata, n.impute=5)
f <- fit.mult.impute(death ~ rcs(age,3) + sex +
                     rcs(bp,5), lrm, a, data=mydata)
```


See @bar04imp for a nice review of multiple
imputation with detailed comparison of results
(point estimates and confidence limits for the effect of the
sometimes-missing predictor) for various imputation methods.
@bar06mul have a good overview of imputation
methods and a comparison of bias and confidence interval coverage for
the methods when applied to longitudinal data with a small number of subjects.
@hor07muc have a good review of several
  software packages for dealing with missing data, and a comparison of
  them with `aregImpute`.  @har07mul provide a
  nice overview of multiple imputation and discuss some of the
  available software.  @whi10bia studied bias
  of multiple imputation vs. complete-case analysis.
  @whi11mul provide much practical guidance.

**Caution**: Methods can generate imputations having very
reasonable distributions but still not having the property that final
response model regression coefficients have nominal confidence
interval coverage.  It is worth checking that imputations generate the
  correct collinearities among covariates.


* With `MICE` and `aregImpute` we are using the chained `r ipacue()`
  equation approach [@whi11mul] `r ipacue()` 
* Chained equations handles a wide variety of target variables to
  be imputed and allows for multiple variables to be missing on the
  same subject
* Iterative process cycles through all target
variables to impute all missing values [@buu06ful]
* Does not attempt to use the full Bayesian
multivariate model for all target variables, making it more
flexible and easy to use
* Possible to create improper imputations, e.g., imputing
  conflicting values for different target variables
* However, simulation studies [@buu06ful] demonstrate
very good performance of imputation based on chained equations

## Likelihood Ratio Tests and Multiple Imputation {#sec-missing-lrt}

* For frequentist-based analysis Wald tests are ultimately unsatisfying for reasons detailed in @sec-mle-hd
   + Also it was never clear that simple averaging of $\hat{\beta}$ over completed datasets is the best approach
* @cha22mul have developed a promising approach to obtaining approximate LRT (likelihood ratio tests) in the presence of missing data
   + [Web site](https://sites.google.com/site/kwchankeith/publications/milrt)
   + [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08822)
   + [R code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mHVT3yV2oX1TCHR9zZgC6XIIwAaB3Gtv/view?usp=sharing)
   + See @woo08how for related work
* Instead of averaging $M$ $\hat{\beta}$ from multiple separate analyses of completed datasets, stacks all completed datasets into one large dataset and computes maximum likelihood estimates on the one large stacked dataset
* Divide LR $\chi^2$ by $M$ to get a rough estimate of the more correct LR described below; need to multiply by a discounting factor to take imputation into account
* Individual fit LRs are used to derive imputation correction factors and the fraction of missing information
* Chan and Meng have a formula that provides more accuate $p$-values by solving for denominator degrees of freedom for an $F$ distribution
   + The degrees of freedom must be computed separately for each hypothesis test
   + Accounts for heavier tail problem mentioned earlier
   + $F$ test denominator d.f. is $\frac{k (M - 1)}{\hat{f}^{2}}$ where $k$ is the numerator d.f. (number of parameters being tested simultaneously), the fraction of missing information $\hat{f} = \frac{\hat{r}}{1+\hat{r}}$, $\hat{r} = \max(0, \frac{M+1}{k(M-1)} (\bar{d} - \hat{d}))$, where $\bar{d}$ is the mean over imputed datasets of the individual LR statistics and $\hat{d}$ is LR on the stacked dataset, divided by $M$
   + Use large $M$ to make the $\chi^2$ approximation better by making the denominator d.f. larger.  E.g., if $k=1$ and $\hat{f}=0.5$, $M=26$ already yields more than 100 denominator d.f. for $F$, making it hard to distinguish from a $\chi_{1}^{2}$ distribution.  If the test statistic is 4.0, the $p$-value $\chi_{1}^{2}$ is 0.0455 and is 0.048 from $F_{1, 100}$.
* `Hmisc` `fit.mult.impute` function run with `lrt=TRUE` runs and saves all the needed LR tests to allow `rms` `processMI` to compute everything else
* `processMI` computes $\hat{f}$, the $F$ test denominator d.f., and the $\chi^2$ discount factor and uses these to get the final imputation-adjusted LR tests
* `fit.mult.impute` computes approximate Wald statistics by multiplying the variance-covariance matrix computed on the stacked data by $M$ if individual completed dataset analyses are not done (not recommended)
* Chan and Meng approach uses $\hat{\beta}$ computed once on stacked data as the MLE in the multiple imputation context; `fit.mult.impute` computes the final $\hat{\beta}$ this way if stacking is done; however the variance-covariance matrix is estimated from Rubin's rule as in the Wald approach first used in this chapter
* Imputation-adjusted LRTs can be a large computational burden for large datasets---for $M$ imputations, $j$ effects being tested requires $(M+1) j$ model fits.  For each imputation, the `rms` `anova` function has very litle overhead though, due to it only computing the design matrix once, and calling low-level fitting functions for all LRTs once the overall model is fitted with a high-level function.

**Example**

```{r}
require(rms)
set.seed(1)
n <- 500
x1 <- runif(n)
x2 <- runif(n)
L  <- x1 + 2*x2
y  <- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(L))
x2[1:300] <- NA   # make 300 observations have missing x2
d <- data.frame(x1, x2, y)
a <- aregImpute(~ y + x1 + x2, n.impute=10, data=d, pr=FALSE)
f <- fit.mult.impute(y ~ x1 + x2, lrm, a, data=d, pr=FALSE)
f
```

In the above results, the LR $\chi^2$ did not account for imputation and is too high.  So are the $R^2$ measures derived from it.

Compute Wald $\chi^2$ test statistics accounting for imputation

```{r}
anova(f)
```

Now compute LR test statistics accounting for imputation

```{r timeit=TRUE}
# lrt=TRUE makes fit.mult.impute set up all the arguments needed for LR tests
h <- fit.mult.impute(y ~ x1 + x2, lrm, a, data=d, lrt=TRUE, pr=FALSE)
h
as <- processMI(h, which='anova')  # LR tests accounting for imputation
as
prmiInfo(as)
```

The Chan & Meng $F$ approximation (`processMI` uses the $\chi^2$ version of it) is needed for `x2` as the denominator d.f. of 14.5 is too low for $p$-values from the $\chi^2$ distribution to well approximate those from the $F$ distribution.  Increase the number of imputations to increase the denominator d.f.

```{r timeit=TRUE}
a <- aregImpute(~ y + x1 + x2, n.impute=50, data=d, pr=FALSE)
h <- fit.mult.impute(y ~ x1 + x2, lrm, a, data=d, lrt=TRUE, pr=FALSE)
h
as <- processMI(h, which='anova')
as
prmiInfo(as)
```

What happens if we use an extremely high number of imputations?

```{r timeit=TRUE}
a <- aregImpute(~ y + x1 + x2, n.impute=500, data=d, pr=FALSE)
h <- fit.mult.impute(y ~ x1 + x2, lrm, a, data=d, lrt=TRUE, pr=FALSE)
h
as <- processMI(h, which='anova')
as
prmiInfo(as)
```

## Diagnostics
`r mrg(sound("missing-5"))` 

* MCAR can be partially assessed by comparing distribution of `r ipacue()`
  non-missing $Y$ for those subjects with complete $X$ vs. those
  subjects having incomplete $X$ [@littlerubin]
* Yucel and Zaslavsky [@yuc08usi; see also @he12dia]
* Interested in reasonableness of imputed values for a
  sometimes-missing predictor $X_{j}$
* Duplicate entire dataset
* In the duplicated observations set all non-missing values of
  $X_{j}$ to missing; let $w$ denote this set of observations set to missing
* Develop imputed values for the missing values of $X_{j}$
* In the observations in $w$ compare the
  distribution of imputed $X_{j}$ to the original values of $X_{j}$
* @bon16gra present a variety of
  useful diagnostics on the reasonableness of imputed values.

: Summary of methods for dealing with missing values {#tbl-na-meth-summary}

The following contains crude guidelines.  Simulation studies are
needed to refine the recommendations.  Here $f$ refers to
the proportion of observations having _any_ variables missing.


* **$f < 0.03$:** `r ipacue()`
  It doesn't matter very much how you impute missings or whether
  you adjust variance of regression coefficient estimates for
  having imputed data in this case.  For
  continuous variables imputing missings with the median
  non-missing value is adequate; for categorical predictors the
  most frequent category can be used.  Complete case analysis is
  also an option here.  Multiple imputation may be needed to check
  that the simple approach "worked."
* **$f \geq 0.03$:**
  Use multiple imputation with number of
  imputations^[@whi11mul recommend choosing $M$ so that the key inferential statistics are very reproducible should the imputation analysis be repeated.  They suggest the use of $100f$ imputations.  See also [@buu12fle, section 2.7].  @hip16num finds that the number of imputations should be quadratically increasing with the fraction of missing information.]
  equal to $\max(5, 100f)$.  Fewer imputations may be possible with
  very large sample
  sizes.  See [statisticalhorizons.com/how-many-imputations](https://statisticalhorizons.com/how-many-imputations).
  Type 1 predictive mean matching is usually preferred, with
  weighted selection of donors.  Account for imputation in estimating
  the covariance matrix for final parameter estimates.  Use the $t$
  distribution instead of the Gaussian distribution for tests and
  confidence intervals, if possible, using the estimated d.f. for the
  parameter estimates.
* **Multiple predictors frequently missing:**  `r ipacue()`
  More imputations may be required.  Perform a "sensitivity to
  order" analysis by creating multiple imputations
  using different orderings of sometimes missing variables.  It may be
  beneficial to initially sort variables so that the one with the most
  `NA`s will be imputed first.  `aregImpute` cycles in the order the analyst specifies variables in the formula.


Reason for missings more important than number of missing values.

Extreme amount of missing data does not prevent one from using
multiple imputation, because alternatives are worse [@jan10mis; @mad19pro].


### Effective Sample Size 
It is useful to look at examples of effective sample sizes in the presence of missing data.  If a sample of 1000 subjects contains various amounts and patterns of missings what size $n_c$ of a complete sample would have equivalent information for the intended purpose of the analysis?


1. A new marker was collected on a random sample of 200 of the subjects and one wants to estimate the added predictive value due to the marker: $n_{c}=200$ `r ipacue()`
1. Height is missing on 100 subjects but we want to study association between BMI and outcome.  Weight, sex, and waist circumference are available on all subjects: $n_{c}=980$
1. Each of 10 predictors is randomly missing on $\frac{1}{10}$ of subjects, and the predictors are uncorrelated with each other and are each weakly related to the outcome: $n_{c}=500$
1. Same as previous but the predictors can somewhat be predicted from non-missing predictors: $n_{c}=750$
1. The outcome variable was not assessed on a random $\frac{1}{5}$ of subjects: $n_{c}=800$
1. The outcome represents sensitive information, is missing on $\frac{1}{2}$ of subjects, and we don't know what made subjects respond to the question: $n_{c}=0$ (serious selection bias)
1. One of the baseline variables was collected prospectively $\frac{1}{2}$ of the time and for the other subjects it was retrospectively estimated only for subjects ultimately suffering a stroke and we don't know which subjects had a stroke: $n_{c}=0$ (study not worth doing)
1. The outcome variable was assessed by emailing the 1000 subjects, for which 800 responded, and we don't know what made subjects respond: $n_{c}=0$ (model will possibly be very biased---at least the intercept)

## Bayesian Methods for Missing Data

* Multiple imputation developed as an approximation to a full `r ipacue()`
  Bayesian model
* Full Bayesian model treats missings as unknown parameters and
  provides exact inference and correct measures of uncertainty
* See [this case study](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms/blob/master/vignettes/brms_missings.Rmd) for an example
* The case study also shows how to do "posterior stacking" if
  you want to avoid having to specify a full model for missings, and
  instead use usual multiple imputations as described in this chapter. See @zho12not.
    + Run a multiple imputation algorithm
    + For each completed dataset run the Bayesian analysis and draw
    thousands of samples from the posterior distribution of the parameters
    + Pool all these posterior draws over all the multiple
    imputations and do posterior inference as usual with no special
    correction required
    + Made easy by the `Hmisc` package `aregImpute` function
    and the `rms` `stackMI` function as demonstrated in the
    Titanic case study later in the notes.

## Study Questions

**Section 3.1**

1. What is the problem with doing ordinary analysis of data from survey responders?

**Section 3.4**

1. What problem is always present when doing complete-case analysis when missing values exist in the data?
1. What problem is often present?
1. Why does imputation not help very much when a variable being imputed is a main variable of interest in the analysis?
1. What is a major reason that adding a new category for a predictor for missings doesn't work?
1. Why does inserting a constant for missing values of a continuous predictor primarily fail?

**Section 3.5**

1. What is a more accurate statement than "imputation boosts the sample size"?
1. What does single-value fill-in of missings almost always damage?
1. What is a general way to describe why predictive mean matching (PMM) works?
1. What is a general advantage of PMM?

**Section 3.6**

1. Why does single conditional mean imputation result in biased regression coefficients?

**Section 3.8**

1. Why can multiple imputation use Y in predicting X?
1. What are the sources of uncertainty that a multiple imputation algorithm must take into account for final standard errors to not be underestimated?

**Section 3.9**

1. Explain the Yucel-Zaslavsky diagnosic and what it is checking for.

**Section 3.10**

1. What is the only reason not to always do 100 or more imputations?

**Section 3.11**

1. If using multiple imputation but within a Bayesian framework, what is a major advantage of posterior stacking over what we have been doing in the frequentist domain?
