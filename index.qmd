# Preface {.unnumbered}

All standard regression models have assumptions that
must be verified for the model to have power to test hypotheses and
for it to be able to predict accurately. Of the principal assumptions
(linearity, additivity, distributional), this course will emphasize
methods for assessing and satisfying the first two.  Practical but
powerful tools are presented for validating model assumptions and
presenting model results. This course provides methods for estimating
the shape of the relationship between predictors and response using
the widely applicable method of augmenting the design matrix using
restricted cubic splines.  Even when assumptions are satisfied,
overfitting can ruin a model's predictive ability for future
observations.  Methods for data reduction will be introduced to deal
with the common case where the number of potential predictors is large
in comparison with the number of observations. Methods of model
validation (bootstrap and cross-validation) will be covered, as will
auxiliary topics such as modeling interaction surfaces,
efficiently utilizing partial covariable data by using multiple
imputation,
variable selection, overly influential observations, collinearity, and
shrinkage, and a brief introduction to the `R` `rms` package
for handling these problems.
The methods covered will apply to almost any regression model, including
ordinary least squares, longitudinal models, logistic regression
models, ordinal regression, quantile regression, longitudinal data
analysis, and survival models.
Statistical models will be contrasted with machine learning so that the student can make an informed choice of predictive tools.

## Target Audience

Statisticians and persons from other
quantitative disciplines who are interested in multivariable
regression analysis of univariate responses, in developing,
validating, and graphically describing multivariable predictive models
and in covariable adjustment in clinical trials.  The
course will be of particular interest to applied statisticians and
developers of applied statistics methodology, graduate students,
clinical and pre-clinical biostatisticians, health services and
outcomes researchers, econometricians, psychometricians, and
quantitative epidemiologists. A good command of ordinary multiple
regression is a prerequisite.

## Learning Goals

Students will

* be able to fit multivariable regression models:
   + accurately
   + in a way the sample size will allow, without overfitting
   + uncovering complex non--linear or non--additive relationships
   + testing for and quantifying the association between one or
        more predictors and the response, with possible adjustment
        for other factors
   + making maximum use of partial data rather than deleting observations
      containing missing variables
* be able to validate models for predictive accuracy
  and to detect overfitting and understand problems caused by overfitting.
* learn techniques of "safe data mining" in which
  significance levels, confidence limits, and measures such as $R^2$
  have the claimed properties.
* learn how to interpret fitted models using both
  parameter estimates and graphics
* learn about the advantages of semiparametric ordinal models for 
  continuous $Y$
* learn about some of the differences between frequentist and
  Bayesian approaches to statistical modeling
* learn differences between machine learning and statistical
  models, and how to determine the better approach depending on the
  nature of the problem

## Course Philosophy {#sec-philosophy}

`r mrg(sound('philosophy'))`
[The audio narration starts with the third bullet point listed here.]{.aside}

* Modeling is the endeavor to transform data into information and information into either prediction or evidence about the data generating mechanism^[Thanks to Drew Levy for ideas that greatly improved this section.]
* Models are usually the best descriptive statistics
    + adjust for one variable while displaying the association with $Y$ and another variable
    + descriptive statistics do not work in higher dimensions
* Satisfaction of model assumptions improves precision and increases
        statistical power
    + Be aware of assumptions, especially those mattering the most
* It is more productive to make a model fit step by step (e.g.,
        transformation estimation) than to postulate a simple model
        and find out what went wrong
    + Model diagnostics are often not actionable
    + Changing the model in reaction to observed patterns $\uparrow$ uncertainty but is reflected by an apparent $\downarrow$ in uncertainty
* Graphical methods should be married to formal inference
* Overfitting occurs frequently, so data reduction and model validation
        are important
* Software without multiple facilities for assessing and fixing model
        fit may only seem to be user-friendly
* Carefully fitting an improper model is better than badly fitting
        (and overfitting) a well-chosen one
    + E.g. small $N$ and overfitting vs. carefully formulated right hand side of model
* Methods which work for all types of regression models are the
        most valuable.
* In most research projects the cost of data collection far
        outweighs the cost of data analysis, so it is important to
        use the most efficient and accurate modeling techniques, to
        avoid categorizing continuous variables, and
        to not remove data from the estimation sample just to be
        able to validate the model.
    + A $100 analysis can make a $1,000,000 study worthless.
* The bootstrap is a breakthrough for statistical modeling and
  model validation.
* Bayesian modeling is ready for prime time.
    + Can incorporate non-data knowledge
    + Provides full exact inferential tools even when penalizing $\beta$
    + Rational way to account for model uncertainty
    + Direct inference: evidence for all possible values of $\beta$
    + More accurate way of dealing with missing data
* Using the data to guide the data analysis is almost as dangerous
        as not doing so.
* A good overall strategy is to decide how many degrees of
  freedom (i.e., number of regression parameters) can be \"spent\",
  where they should be spent, to spend them with no regrets.

## Review Questions

1. Consider inference from comparing central tendencies of two groups on a continuous response variable Y.  What assumptions are you willing to make when selecting a statistical test?  Why are you willing to make those assumptions?
1. Consider the comparison of 5 groups on a continuous Y.  Suppose you observe that two of the groups have a similar mean and the other three also have a similar sample mean.  What is wrong with combining the two samples and combining the three samples, then comparing two means?  How does this compare to stepwise variable selection?
1. Name a specific statistical test for which we don't have a corresponding statistical model
1. Concerning a multi-group problem or a sequential testing problem what is the frequentist approach to multiplicity correction?  The Bayesian approach?
